In recent years, people's spending on 3D modeling has gradually increased. Among them, spending on hardware is far greater than on software and services. This project uses a typical monocular camera to scan to reduce the hardware cost of users in 3D modeling. At the same time, the modeling results are improved by scanning the in-hand object. Among various 3D scanning technologies, compared with technologies that require the object to be stationary during the scanning process, scanning an object by hand can collect more comprehensive surface information about the object, resulting in better results. In order to enable users to use the system conveniently and quickly, this project implements a web-based user interface so that users can enjoy a consistent service experience on different devices and platforms. This project uses U2-net and ORB-SLAM to build a 3D reconstruction system that can scan hand-held objects and feedback in real time, in order to obtain a good user experience.
